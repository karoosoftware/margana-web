# Margana Monorepo Split Strategy

This document outlines the proposed strategy for refactoring the current Margana monorepo into a multi-repository (polyrepo) architecture. This will separate the Vue frontend, Python backend/scripts, and Terraform infrastructure while maintaining necessary links and shared components.

## Proposed Repositories


### 1. `margana-web` (Frontend)
**Contents:**
- `src/`: Vue source code, components, services, and assets.
- `public/`: Static public assets.
- `scripts/`: Frontend-specific build scripts (e.g., `build-xor-filter.ts`).
- `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`: Node.js and Vite configuration.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- UI/UX implementation.
- Client-side word validation (via XOR filters).
- Consumption of backend APIs and S3-hosted game data.

---

### 2. `margana-backend` (Backend & Data)
**Contents:**
- `python/lambdas/`: Lambda handler entrypoints.
- `python/ecs/`: Future ECS/container entrypoints for puzzle generation jobs.
- `python/`: Shared Python packages (`margana_gen`, `margana_score`, `margana_metrics`, etc.).
- `postmarkTemplates/`: Email templates used by backend services.
- `resources/`: Sample events and test data for backend services.
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`: Python dependency management.
- **Note:** The `margana-word-list.txt` is fetched from S3 during the build/CI-CD process and bundled into the Lambda Layers.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Daily puzzle generation.
- Result processing and scoring logic.
- Email notifications (Postmark).
- API Gateway backend logic.

---

### 3. `margana-infra` (Infrastructure)
**Contents:**
- `infra/`: Terraform modules and environment configurations.
- `infra/envs/`: Environment-specific variables (preprod, prod).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Provisioning AWS resources (S3, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, CloudFront, etc.).
- Managing IAM policies and networking.

---

## Managing Shared Components and Links

### 1. Shared Build-Time Assets
The backend currently depends on shared build-time assets for puzzle generation, validation, and scoring consistency:

- `margana-word-list.txt`
- `horizontal-exclude-words.txt`
- `letter-scores-v3.json`

The word list is the most critical link between Python (runtime validation/generation) and Vue (build-time XOR filter generation). The horizontal exclude list and letter score configuration should be managed using the same pattern so puzzle-generation jobs and backend scoring do not rely on Git-committed canonical copies.

**Strategy:**
- **Source of Truth:** A dedicated S3 bucket (e.g., `margana-static-assets`) managed by `margana-infra`.
- **Backend Consumption (Build-Time):** During the `margana-backend` CI/CD build process (specifically when creating Python Lambda Layers), the word list is downloaded from S3 and placed into `python/margana_score/data/`. This ensures the word list is bundled with the code, providing **zero runtime latency** and avoiding extra S3 calls in the Lambdas.
- **Backend Consumption for Puzzle Jobs (Build-Time):** During backend packaging for ECS/job workloads, `horizontal-exclude-words.txt` should also be downloaded from S3 and placed in the path expected by the puzzle-generation job packaging process.
- **Backend Consumption for Shared Scoring Configuration (Build-Time):** During backend packaging, `letter-scores-v3.json` should be downloaded from S3 and placed in the path expected by both ECS/job packaging and any backend scoring components that depend on canonical letter scores.
- **Frontend Consumption (Build-Time):** During the `margana-web` CI/CD build process, the word list is downloaded from S3 before running `npm run build:wordfilter` to generate the XOR filters.
- **Benefits:**
  - Single source of truth (S3).
  - No runtime dependency on S3 for word validation.
  - Consistent validation, puzzle-generation behavior, and scoring configuration across repositories by using the exact same source files at build time.

### 2. Infrastructure & Backend Decoupling
Currently, Terraform builds Lambda packages by referencing local Python paths.

**Strategy:**
- **Artifact-Based Deployment:** Update the `margana-backend` CI/CD to package Lambda functions into `.zip` files and upload them to an S3 "Build Artifacts" bucket.
- **Terraform Update:** Modify `margana-infra` to use `s3_bucket` and `s3_key` in `aws_lambda_function` resources instead of `source_file` or `source_dir`.

### 3. Shared Data Models (JSON Contracts)
The frontend and backend share JSON formats for files like `margana-completed.json`.

**Strategy:**
- **Documentation:** Maintain a shared API/Contract documentation (e.g., in a `docs` folder or a separate Wiki).
- **Schema Validation:** Consider introducing JSON Schema files in the `margana-backend` repo that can be used for testing in both backend and frontend.
- **Split cleanup note (2026-03-13):** `badge-milestones.json` is temporarily duplicated in `margana-web` and backend Python-owned code so the frontend no longer depends on a monorepo `python/` import path. `letter-scores-v3.json` is also still effectively shared configuration across repos. After the split stabilizes, consolidate these into clearly owned single sources of truth.

### 4. Configuration Sharing
The frontend requires AWS resource IDs (Cognito Pool IDs, API Endpoints) generated by Terraform.

**Strategy:**
- **Environment Variables:** Terraform should continue to output these values.
- **Automated Update:** Use a script or CI/CD step to update the `.env` files in `margana-web` with values from Terraform outputs, or have the frontend fetch configuration at runtime from an `aws-exports.json` style file hosted on S3.

---

## Repository Visibility and CI/CD
To leverage free CI/CD resources (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD), the new repositories will be set as **Public**.

- **Security:** Ensure that no secrets (AWS keys, API keys, etc.) are committed to the repositories. Use repository secrets (Action Secrets/CI Variables) for deployment.
- **Access Control:** While the code is public, access to the AWS environment is controlled via IAM roles and secrets managed by `margana-infra`.

---

## Phased Implementation Roadmap (Priority Ordered)

To ensure a smooth transition without breaking the existing application, the migration will follow a phased approach. The original monorepo will remain the primary production source until all phases are complete and verified.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Foundation (High Priority)
**Goal:** Prepare the shared AWS resources that will act as the "bridge" between the new repositories.
1.  **Initialize `margana-infra` repo:** Port existing Terraform code and modules.
2.  **Provision S3 "Static Assets" Bucket:** For the `margana-word-list.txt` (managed by `margana-infra`).
3.  **Provision S3 "Build Artifacts" Bucket:** To store Lambda `.zip` files (managed by `margana-infra`).
4.  **Initial Word List Upload:** Manually or via a script, upload the current word list to the Static Assets bucket.

### Phase 2: Backend Migration & Artifact-Based Deployment
**Goal:** Decouple the Python code from the infrastructure deployment.
1.  **Initialize `margana-backend` repo:** Migrate the `python/`, `resources/`, and `postmarkTemplates/` directories.
2.  **Setup Backend CI/CD:**
    -   Use **GitHub Actions** as the CI/CD runner for `margana-backend`.
    -   Use **AWS OIDC** federation from GitHub Actions to AWS instead of long-lived AWS access keys.
    -   Split this work into the following implementation steps:

    **Phase 2.2.1: Define deployment inventory**
    -   Identify which files in `python/lambdas/` are actual Lambda entrypoints.
    -   Separate deployable Lambdas from local-only scripts, utilities, and one-off admin tools.
    -   Keep future puzzle-generation ECS jobs under `python/ecs/` so they are excluded from Lambda packaging.
    -   Decide which shared Python packages must be bundled with every Lambda (`margana_score`, `margana_gen`, `margana_metrics`, `margana_costing`, etc.).
    -   Document the expected artifact naming convention for each Lambda package.
    -   Status (2026-03-12): complete in `margana-backend`; see `docs/deployment-inventory.md`.

    **Phase 2.2.2: Configure GitHub Actions authentication to AWS**
    -   Add a GitHub Actions workflow for backend build and packaging.
    -   Configure the workflow with `permissions` required for OIDC, including `id-token: write`.
    -   Create an AWS IAM OIDC identity provider for `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` if not already present.
    -   Create a dedicated IAM role for this repository to assume from GitHub Actions.
    -   Restrict the IAM role trust policy to this repository and the intended branch/environment using the GitHub `sub` claim.
    -   Grant the role the minimum required permissions:
        -   read access to the required canonical objects in the Static Assets bucket,
        -   write access to the `backend/` prefix in the Build Artifacts bucket,
        -   bucket-level access needed for validation checks.
    -   Avoid storing long-lived AWS credentials in GitHub secrets.
    -   Status (2026-03-12): preprod implementation complete and verified.
    -   Completed preprod setup:
        -   AWS IAM OIDC provider created for `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` with audience `sts.amazonaws.com`.
        -   GitHub Actions role created: `arn:aws:iam::992468223519:role/margana-github-backend-preprod`.
        -   Trust policy verified for GitHub Environment-based subject matching:
            -   `repo:karoosoftware/margana-backend:environment:preprod`
        -   GitHub Environment variables configured in `karoosoftware/margana-backend` for `preprod`:
            -   `AWS_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`
            -   `AWS_REGION`
            -   `STATIC_ASSETS_BUCKET`
            -   `BUILD_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET`
            -   `BUILD_ARTIFACTS_PREFIX`
        -   Workflow authentication verified from GitHub Actions using `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`.
        -   Successful `aws sts get-caller-identity` run confirmed role assumption from GitHub Actions.
        -   Successful read test from `margana-static-assets-preprod` confirmed access to `margana-word-list.txt`.
        -   Successful write test to `margana-build-artifacts-preprod/backend/oidc-check.txt` confirmed artifact upload permissions.
    -   Preprod values currently in use:
        -   `AWS_REGION=eu-west-2`
        -   `STATIC_ASSETS_BUCKET=margana-static-assets-preprod`
        -   `BUILD_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET=margana-build-artifacts-preprod`
        -   `BUILD_ARTIFACTS_PREFIX=backend`
    -   Implementation note:
        -   Because the workflow uses a GitHub Environment (`environment: preprod`), the IAM trust policy must match the environment-based GitHub OIDC subject, not only a branch ref such as `refs/heads/main`.
    -   Remaining work:
        -   replicate the same pattern for `prod` when required,
        -   remove temporary workflow diagnostics once backend CI is stable,
        -   continue with Phase 2.2.3 asset placement and packaging integration.

    **Phase 2.2.3: Add build-time word list retrieval**
    -   Download the canonical `margana-word-list.txt` from the Static Assets bucket during the workflow.
    -   Download `horizontal-exclude-words.txt` from the same Static Assets bucket during the workflow for puzzle-generation job packaging.
    -   Download `letter-scores-v3.json` from the same Static Assets bucket during the workflow.
    -   Place it into the path expected by the packaging/build logic, currently `layer-root/python/margana_score/data/margana-word-list.txt`.
    -   Place `horizontal-exclude-words.txt` into the path expected by the ECS/job packaging logic.
    -   Place `letter-scores-v3.json` into the path expected by shared scoring logic and ECS/job packaging.
    -   Keep all canonical build-fetched assets out of Git where they are intended to be supplied by CI/CD.
    -   Ensure the workflow fails clearly if any required asset cannot be retrieved.
    -   Keep test-only fixtures separate from the runtime bundled assets.
    -   Status (2026-03-12): started in `preprod`; direct S3 retrieval of canonical assets from GitHub Actions has been validated.
    -   Implementation note (2026-03-12): this phase is being delivered in two passes.
        -   Pass 1 is Lambda-focused and only fetches `margana-word-list.txt` into `layer-root/python/margana_score/data/margana-word-list.txt` so Lambda packaging can proceed.
        -   Pass 2 will add `horizontal-exclude-words.txt` and `letter-scores-v3.json` when ECS/job packaging is implemented.

    **Phase 2.2.4: Add repeatable Python environment setup**
    -   Standardize the CI Python version (currently Python 3.12 based on `pyproject.toml`).
    -   Install the package and dev/test dependencies in a repeatable way.
    -   Prefer `pyproject.toml` as the source of truth for development/test dependencies.
    -   Ensure the workflow can run from a clean checkout with no local-only assumptions.

    **Phase 2.2.5: Run backend validation in CI**
    -   Run the Python test suite in GitHub Actions.
    -   Ensure tests do not rely on untracked local files or manually prepared environments.
    -   Fail the workflow if tests fail.
    -   Optionally add formatting/linting later, but the minimum requirement for Phase 2.2 is test execution.

    **Phase 2.2.6: Package Lambda artifacts**
    -   Build deployable Lambda artifacts using a shared-layer model.
    -   Produce:
        -   one shared Lambda Layer artifact for common Python runtime code and assets,
        -   one thin handler `.zip` per Lambda entrypoint under `lambdas/`.
    -   The shared layer should include:
        -   shared internal packages required by deployed Lambdas such as `margana_score`, `margana_metrics`, and `margana_costing`,
        -   bundled runtime assets such as `layer-root/python/margana_score/data/margana-word-list.txt`,
        -   other package-scoped runtime config such as `layer-root/python/margana_metrics/badge-milestones.json`.
    -   The thin handler zip should include only the specific Lambda handler file from `lambdas/`.
    -   Exclude `ecs/` jobs from Lambda packaging.
    -   Avoid duplicating shared internal packages across every handler zip when they are already provided by the shared layer.
    -   Keep the packaging output deterministic and suitable for reuse by Terraform.
    -   Status (2026-03-13): implemented in `preprod`; the workflow builds one shared layer artifact plus thin handler zips and uploads them to the Build Artifacts bucket.
    -   Current repo source of truth: see `docs/deployment-inventory.md` for shared layer contents and handler-to-layer expectations.
    -   Implementation notes (2026-03-13):
        -   a first workflow draft that packaged full per-Lambda zips was explored,
        -   artifact inspection showed each zip incorrectly contained all Lambda handlers because the project install pulled in the full old handler package,
        -   that approach was replaced with a shared-layer build plus thin handler zips,
        -   thin handler artifacts are now discovered dynamically from the `lambdas/` directory by the packaging script,
        -   the shared layer now copies only internal shared packages and runtime assets from `layer-root/python/`; it does not vendor the AWS SDK stack.

    **Phase 2.2.7: Publish artifacts to S3**
    -   Upload generated Lambda handler `.zip` files and the shared layer `.zip` to the Build Artifacts bucket.
    -   Use a predictable S3 key structure, for example by repository, branch/environment, and commit SHA.
    -   Capture artifact names/paths as workflow outputs so they can be consumed by later deployment steps.
    -   Ensure uploaded artifacts are immutable or versioned enough to support traceable deployments.
    -   Status (2026-03-13): implemented in `preprod`.
    -   Current published artifact shape:
        -   shared layer artifact: `shared-python-deps-layer__<git-sha>.zip`
        -   thin handler artifacts: one `<logical-name>__<git-sha>.zip` per discovered handler file in `lambdas/`
        -   S3 key layout: `backend/preprod/<git-sha>/<artifact-name>`

    **Phase 2.2.8: Define workflow triggers and release behavior**
    -   Run validation on pull requests.
    -   Run build/package on pushes to the main deployment branch.
    -   Decide whether artifact upload happens:
        -   on every main branch push, or
        -   only on tagged releases / manual workflow dispatch.
    -   Keep deployment to infrastructure changes out of this phase; this phase only produces validated artifacts.

    **Phase 2.2.9: Document required CI/CD configuration**
    -   Document the required GitHub repository settings, AWS role ARN, bucket names, and environment variables.
    -   Document which values are expected to come from GitHub repository variables, GitHub environments, or workflow inputs.
    -   Record the intended artifact naming/path convention so `margana-infra` can consume it in Phase 2.3.
    -   Status (2026-03-13): partially implemented.
        -   Backend CI now uses a repo-owned packaging script to build the shared layer and thin handler artifacts.
        -   Handler artifact discovery is dynamic from `lambdas/`; Terraform remains the source of truth for which artifacts are actually deployed.

    **Phase 2.2 exit criteria**
    -   A clean GitHub Actions run can:
        -   authenticate to AWS via OIDC,
        -   download the word list,
        -   install dependencies,
        -   run tests,
        -   package the backend Lambdas using the shared-layer plus thin-handler model,
        -   upload the artifacts to the Build Artifacts bucket.
    -   No long-lived AWS access keys are required in GitHub.
    -   The generated artifact locations are stable enough for infrastructure integration in Phase 2.3.
3.  **Update `margana-infra`:** Modify `aws_lambda_function` resources to point to the Build Artifacts bucket instead of local files.
    -   **Phase 2.3: Switch Terraform to backend-published artifacts**
    -   Status (2026-03-13): implemented in `preprod`; `prod` intentionally deferred until the remaining monorepo refactoring is complete.
    -   Completed in `preprod`:
        -   `aws_lambda_function` resources now load handler code from the Build Artifacts bucket using `s3_bucket` / `s3_key`.
 
### Phase 3: Frontend Build And Static Site Deployment
**Goal:** Make `margana-web` build and deploy independently to the preprod static website stack managed by `margana-infra`.
1.  **Phase 3.1: Define the frontend build contract**
    -   Confirm the standalone frontend build inputs:
        -   Node.js version from `package.json`
        -   Vite environment values for `preprod`
        -   build-time `margana-word-list.txt` in `build-assets/`
    -   Remove remaining frontend imports that assume the monorepo layout.
    -   Document temporary duplicated/shared config that still spans repos:
        -   `badge-milestones.json`
        -   `letter-scores-v3.json`
    -   Status (2026-03-13): implemented in `margana-web`.
    -   Completed in `preprod`:
        -   `scripts/build-xor-filter.ts` reads `build-assets/margana-word-list.txt`
        -   frontend-only docs added for env vars and build inputs
        -   stale frontend imports from `python/` removed for badge milestones

2.  **Phase 3.2: Add frontend CI build validation**
    -   Add a GitHub Actions workflow in `margana-web`.
    -   Authenticate to AWS via GitHub OIDC.
    -   Download `margana-word-list.txt` from the Static Assets bucket.
    -   Run:
        -   `npm ci`
        -   `npm run build:wordfilter`
        -   `npm run build:preprod`
    -   Upload `dist/` as a workflow artifact for inspection.
    -   Status (2026-03-13): implemented and verified in `preprod`.
    -   Current workflow behavior:
        -   uses the GitHub `preprod` Environment
        -   reads the canonical word list from `margana-static-assets-preprod`
        -   produces a build artifact only; it does not yet publish to the website bucket

3.  **Phase 3.3: Enable frontend deployment permissions in `margana-infra`**
    -   Extend the GitHub OIDC/AWS setup so `karoosoftware/margana-web` can deploy the built frontend to preprod.
    -   Current infra context in `envs/preprod`:
        -   the static website bucket is created by `module "s3_static_website"` with bucket name `preprod.margana.co.uk`
        -   CloudFront is created by `module "cloudfront_dist"` in front of that bucket
        -   the existing GitHub Actions role currently named `margana-github-backend-preprod` already trusts `karoosoftware/margana-web`, but its attached policy only covers static asset reads and backend artifact writes
    -   Required infra work:
        -   decide whether to keep using the shared GitHub Actions role or create a dedicated frontend deploy role
        -   grant the web workflow minimum required S3 permissions on the website bucket:
            -   `s3:ListBucket`
            -   `s3:GetBucketLocation`
            -   `s3:PutObject`
            -   `s3:DeleteObject`
            -   `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
        -   grant minimum required CloudFront permissions for invalidation:
            -   `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation`
            -   read permissions if needed for validation/debugging
        -   keep build-asset read access to `margana-static-assets-preprod`
        -   expose or document the deploy target identifiers needed by CI:
            -   website bucket name
            -   CloudFront distribution ID
    -   Recommended infra follow-up:
        -   add Terraform outputs for the website bucket name and CloudFront distribution ID in `margana-infra/envs/preprod/output.tf`
        -   document the intended GitHub Environment variables for `margana-web`

4.  **Phase 3.4: Add deploy job in `margana-web`**
    -   Extend the frontend workflow so deploy runs only after a successful preprod build.
    -   Sync `dist/` to the preprod website bucket.
    -   Remove files that are no longer present in the current build output.
    -   Create a CloudFront invalidation after the upload completes.
    -   Recommended implementation shape:
        -   `aws s3 sync dist/ s3://preprod.margana.co.uk --delete`
        -   `aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <id> --paths "/*"`
    -   Decide deploy trigger behavior:
        -   automatic on `main` push, or
        -   manual `workflow_dispatch`, or
        -   build on pull requests and deploy only on `main`
    -   Ensure the workflow fails clearly if bucket sync or invalidation fails.

5.  **Phase 3.5: Align frontend CI configuration with infra outputs**
    -   Configure the `preprod` GitHub Environment in `karoosoftware/margana-web` with the values required by both build and deploy.
    -   Minimum expected variables after deploy is added:
        -   `AWS_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`
        -   `AWS_REGION`
        -   `STATIC_ASSETS_BUCKET`
        -   optional `STATIC_ASSETS_PREFIX`
        -   optional `WORD_LIST_OBJECT_KEY`
        -   `FRONTEND_BUCKET`
        -   `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`
    -   Longer-term improvement:
        -   reduce manual duplication between Terraform-managed resource IDs and committed `.env.preprod`
        -   decide whether frontend env values should be generated from Terraform outputs, stored as GitHub Environment variables, or published as runtime config

6.  **Phase 3.6: Validate the end-to-end preprod frontend deploy**
    -   Confirm a clean GitHub Actions run can:
        -   authenticate via OIDC
        -   fetch `margana-word-list.txt`
        -   build XOR filters
        -   build the Vite preprod bundle
        -   sync `dist/` to the website bucket with deletion enabled
        -   invalidate CloudFront successfully
    -   Confirm the deployed preprod site serves the expected new assets and does not retain stale files.
    -   Confirm the preprod frontend still points at the intended preprod API, Cognito, and S3 resources.

7.  **Phase 3.7: Post-split cleanup across repos**
    -   Revisit shared configuration duplication after both frontend and backend are stable outside the monorepo.
    -   Decide single ownership for:
        -   `badge-milestones.json`
        -   `letter-scores-v3.json`
        -   any other build-fetched canonical assets that should move fully to S3-managed distribution
    -   Remove now-obsolete monorepo assumptions from docs, CI, and committed env files.
        -   Terraform no longer packages Lambda handlers from local source in `margana-infra`.
        -   the three local internal layer builds were replaced with one shared S3-backed Lambda layer resource using `shared-python-deps-layer__<git-sha>.zip`.
        -   Lambda keys and `lambda_arns` output keys were normalized to the canonical backend artifact logical names.
        -   dashboard query templates now resolve from `monitoring/logs_queries/`.
    -   Outstanding for `prod` once the monorepo refactor is complete:
        -   choose the backend artifact SHA to deploy and update `envs/prod/prod.auto.tfvars`,
        -   run the `terraform state mv` sequence for the renamed `module.lambda[...]` keys in `envs/prod`,
        -   run a `terraform plan` in `envs/prod` and verify all handler and shared-layer artifact keys exist in the Build Artifacts bucket,
        -   apply the `prod` cutover to switch handlers and shared layer to S3-backed artifacts,
        -   apply the follow-up cleanup to remove the obsolete local layer build resources from `prod` state.
4.  **Verification:** Deploy backend changes to `preprod` from the new repositories and verify functionality.

### Phase 3: Frontend Migration
**Goal:** Move the UI to its own lifecycle.
1.  **Initialize `margana-web` repo:** Migrate `src/`, `public/`, and frontend configs.
2.  **Setup Frontend CI/CD:**
    -   Fetch `margana-word-list.txt` from S3.
    -   Run `npm run build:wordfilter`.
    -   Build and deploy to the frontend hosting (e.g., S3/CloudFront).
3.  **Verification:** Ensure the new frontend correctly communicates with the backend APIs.

    **Phase 3 current handoff status (2026-03-13)**
    -   Backend split work for `preprod` is complete enough for the frontend split to proceed:
        -   backend CI publishes thin handler zips plus a shared layer zip,
        -   `margana-infra` `preprod` consumes those S3-published artifacts,
        -   `prod` infrastructure cutover is intentionally deferred until the broader split is finished.
    -   The next active workstream is therefore the frontend migration in `margana-web`.

    **Concrete Phase 3 implementation plan**
    -   **Phase 3.1: Define the frontend build contract**
        -   Decide exactly which external inputs the frontend build requires for `preprod`.
        -   At minimum, define:
            -   `STATIC_ASSETS_BUCKET`,
            -   `AWS_REGION`,
            -   frontend environment values for API base URL, Cognito identifiers, and any hosted asset/config URLs.
        -   Record how the frontend will distinguish `preprod` from `prod`.

    -   **Phase 3.2: Inventory current frontend build dependencies**
        -   Inspect the current frontend build to identify monorepo-local assumptions.
        -   Confirm:
            -   where the word list is expected before `npm run build:wordfilter`,
            -   whether XOR filter generation depends only on `margana-word-list.txt`,
            -   which environment/config values are currently hardcoded,
            -   whether any frontend build steps reference files outside the frontend repo boundary.
        -   Treat this as the source-of-truth discovery step before changing CI/CD.

    -   **Phase 3.3: Add build-time word-list retrieval**
        -   Authenticate to AWS from frontend CI.
        -   Download `margana-word-list.txt` from the Static Assets bucket during the build.
        -   Place it in the path expected by the frontend XOR filter build step.
        -   Fail clearly if the object is missing or cannot be read.

    -   **Phase 3.4: Externalize frontend environment configuration**
        -   Remove reliance on local-only or monorepo-only configuration assumptions.
        -   Decide whether frontend config is supplied:
            -   at build time from Terraform outputs / CI variables, or
            -   at runtime from a hosted config file.
        -   Prefer the smallest change that preserves the current frontend architecture.

    -   **Phase 3.5: Add `preprod` frontend CI/CD**
        -   Standardize Node install/build steps from a clean checkout.
        -   Fetch the canonical word list from S3.
        -   Run `npm run build:wordfilter`.
        -   Build the frontend.
        -   Publish the frontend to the `preprod` hosting target.
        -   Invalidate CloudFront if needed.
        -   Prefer GitHub Actions + AWS OIDC rather than long-lived AWS credentials.

    -   **Phase 3.6: Verify end-to-end behavior in `preprod`**
        -   Confirm the frontend loads from the `preprod` URL.
        -   Confirm authentication flows work.
        -   Confirm frontend API calls hit the split backend correctly.
        -   Confirm word validation/XOR filter behavior still matches the canonical word list.
        -   Confirm any shared JSON/data contracts still behave as expected.

    -   **Phase 3.7: Document the frontend operational contract**
        -   Record required repository variables, AWS role configuration, bucket names, and environment values.
        -   Document how the frontend receives Terraform-managed configuration.
        -   Document the build-time dependency on the Static Assets bucket.
        -   Record the `preprod` rollout procedure so `prod` can follow later.

    **Immediate next step**
    -   Start with Phase 3.1 and Phase 3.2 together in `margana-web`.
    -   The first implementation task is to inspect the frontend build and write down:
        -   where the word list is currently sourced,
        -   how `build:wordfilter` consumes it,
        -   which config values the app requires from infrastructure,
        -   which repo-relative or monorepo-relative paths must be removed during the split.

### Phase 4: Final Verification & Cutover
**Goal:** Ensure parity and switch production traffic.
1.  **End-to-End Testing:** Validate the entire application using only the new repositories in a staging environment.
2.  **DNS/Traffic Switch:** Update CloudFront/Route53 to point to the new deployments.
3.  **Monorepo Retirement:** Once stable, the original monorepo can be archived.

---
*Note: During this process, any critical bug fixes should be applied to both the monorepo (for immediate production support) and the relevant new repository until the cutover is complete.*
